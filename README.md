# moneyball

## Synopsis

The purpose of this repository is to put together an a roster of cheap baseball players
who had great on base percentages (OBP) for any given year using data from seanlahman.com.

In the movie / book "Moneyball" - data analysis is employed to discover that teams that had a
roster containing players with a high on base percentage (OBP) did very well in the regular
season. Using this knowledge the General Manager was able to create a very successful team
on a shoestring budget with players that had a high OBP.

The Jupyter Notebook called moneyball.ipynb joins together many of the different tables from
the data and uses a specially designed function that returns a DataFrame object containing the
full roster of the "best" team.
